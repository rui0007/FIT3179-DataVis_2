        <h1>Analysis of the Evolving COVID-19 Situation in Australia</h1>


        <section>

                <p id="p1">
                  Since January 2020, the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has swept across the globe due to it being highly infectious and easily transmitted. 
                  While Australia has responded by implementing various policies including lockdown and mandatory tests to contain the spread, COVID-19 is never fully eradicated. Interestingly, 
                  the COVID-19 situation constantly evolves in response to the different measures being implemented throughout 2020. 
                  Moreover, as Australians generally have a differing attitude towards COVID-19 containment policies, they may have acted differently thereby contributing to the situation. 
                  This work presents an overview of the evolving situation in Australia by evaluating the key indicators to provide some insights.

                <p id="p2">
                  Australia had initially adopted the strategy of eradicating COVID-19 in 2020, the government urged for mandatory swab tests across the nation to identify the cases for treatment and isolation. The two states with significantly higher number of test cases are New South Whales and Victoria (as indicated by the darker shades of regions). 
                  While ACT and Northern Territory have the least number of test cases.

                  This graph depicts the evolution of COVID-19 situation in different states of Australia in 2020. The severity of the situation could be proxied by the number of confirmed cases across the months. Following the initial COVID-19 pandemic, all states showed a spike in the number from February to March 2020 with the largest increase in New South Whales (probably due to it has most number of tests). Then the number quickly decreased probably due to the implementation of strict border restrictions and lockdown measures to contain the spread. However a sharp increase was only observed in Victoria state from June to September 2020, reaching the peak of 8,503 cases in August while the number of confirmed cases remained at below 200 cases for other states. Apparently, Victoria had a big outbreak but the spread was contained within the state due to the prompt lockdown of the state. The situation was stabilized in the last quarter with most states seeing a few hundred cases per month.

                  The total death toll in 2020 was 915 with approximately 90% of the death cases from Victoria. 
                  New South Wales contributed to about 6.0% and the rest of the states contributed 4%. 
                  This shows that there is unequal distribution of death cases across Australia with Victoria being most severely affected.

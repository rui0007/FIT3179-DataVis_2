        <h1>Analysis of the Evolving COVID-19 Situation in Australia</h1>

          <h1>Introduction</h1>
          <div class="content">
            Since January 2020, the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has swept across the globe due to it being highly infectious and easily transmitted. 
                  While Australia has responded by implementing various policies including lockdown and mandatory tests to contain the spread, COVID-19 is never fully eradicated. Interestingly, 
                  the COVID-19 situation constantly evolves in response to the different measures being implemented throughout 2020. 
                  Moreover, as Australians generally have a differing attitude towards COVID-19 containment policies, they may have acted differently thereby contributing to the situation. 
                  This work presents an overview of the evolving situation in Australia by evaluating the key indicators to provide some insights.

                  Australia had initially adopted the strategy of eradicating COVID-19 in 2020, the government urged for mandatory swab tests across the nation to identify the cases for treatment and isolation. The two states with significantly higher number of test cases are New South Whales and Victoria (as indicated by the darker shades of regions). 
                  While ACT and Northern Territory have the least number of test cases.

                    The chart only shows VIC and NSW data of total death, while other state the total death number is below 50 combine as others. In the year 2020
                    ,there is no one died of covid-19.

                  The total death toll in 2020 was 915 with approximately 90% of the death cases from Victoria. 
                  New South Wales contributed to about 6.0% and the rest of the states contributed 4%. 
                  This shows that there is unequal distribution of death cases across Australia with Victoria being most severely affected.
